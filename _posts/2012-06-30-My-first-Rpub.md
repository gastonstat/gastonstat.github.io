I'm quite impressed with [Rstudio](http://rstudio.org/), an integrated development 
environment (IDE) for R. If you haven't tried it yet, I strongly recommend you to do so, 
you won't regret it.

One of the great things about RStudio is that it allows you to work with 
[R markdown](http://rstudio.org/docs/authoring/using_markdown) which is great for 
creating reproducible web reports with a fairly simple syntax. 

Although I've been playing with RStudio and R markdown for a while, I recently decided 
to try [RPubs](href="http://rpubs.com/), a service provided by RStudio in which you 
can publish documents on the web *with the click of a button*.

Anyway, I just wanted to share [my first Rpub](http://rpubs.com/gaston/hurricanes) about 
visualizing hurricane trajectories in North America. For those readers interested in 
the *behind the scenes* issues, here's the [code](https://gist.github.com/gastonstat/3025572) 
I used in RStudio to create the markdown file for my first RPub.
