After two weeks of hacking and consulting forums, tutorials and posts, I'm launching my 
new jekyll-powered website.

### Goodbye Google sites and wordpress

So far I had been using [google sites](http://www.google.com/sites/help/intl/en/overview.html) 
to host my personal website, and [wordpress](http://en.wordpress.com/) for blogging. 

Both *google sites* and *wordpress* allow you to have a free website/weblog in a very 
accessible way. They both have basic themes and simple gui's that don't require you 
to program a single line of code... which is really good if you are an illiterate web 
programmer like me. I even recommend them to my students and colleagues to start 
having an online presence besides the typical social network profile.

What I liked the most about *google sites* is that all my google products (presentations, 
docs, tables, drive, plus, picasa, youtube, etc) could be integrated in a painless way. 
In addition, the learning curve was very mellow and I gained enough confidence to start 
playing with *html* format and other less basic options. However, as I started to learn 
more about html and css, I felt very limited with the provided options of *google sites*. 
That was the main reason why I started to look for other more flexible alternatives.

On the *wordpress* side, I think it is as good as *google sites* if you want to have a basic 
weblog. Of course you can also install the more advanced and customizable version, but 
that requires you to spend more time learning the nitty gritty stuff.

What I learned so far is that having two sites is not the most brilliant idea. It wasn't 
that terrible but my blog was cannibalizing my site. And another drawback was that I had 
to maintain two intertwined products. So the obvious question was: Why not having 
everything in one single place?


### Why Jekyll?

I don't remember when was the first time I heard about [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). 
I even tried it long time ago but I got a bit scared with all the options and files that 
I needed to modify in order to have a running static stie. 

However, the more jekyll-based sites I saw, the more I felt drawn to give it one more try. 
Among several reasons, these are the ones I felt more attracted to (and intrigued by):

- No need to use databases 
- Can work with simple plain text files (e.g. [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)) 
- Free hosting with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/)
- Possibility to [blog with knitr-generated](http://jfisher-usgs.github.io/r/2012/07/03/knitr-jekyll/) files 


### Jekyll Tutorials

I won't lie to you: it wasn't easy for me to start with *jekyll*... but it wasn't 
impossible either. It required a good dosis of patience, and a lot of hours a day looking 
for information, tutorials, forums, and examples on how to build a website with *jekyll*. 
It also required me a lot of experimenting, iterations, and going through a couple of 
very frustrating moments wondering what was wrong when something didn't work as expected 
(although this happens to me every time I'm learning something new).

The good news is that you can have a basic *jekyll* default template in an almost 
immediate way. This template is the one used by [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com/). 
If you like this option, then you are ready to go. However, I bet you will want to have 
a different design. In case you need some inspiration there is a list of 
[Jekyll-powered blogs](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/sites) that you can take a 
look at. I strongly encourage you to check them since you also have access to their 
source code.

Here's a short list of tutorials I found useful (of course, you can find many more links 
out there and even some youtube videos)

- [Jekyll Resources](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/resources/) 
- [Building static sites with jekyll](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/other/building-static-sites-with-jekyll/) 
by Andrew Burgess

- [Learning jekyll](http://carlboettiger.info/2012/12/30/learning-jekyll.html) by Carl 
Boettiger
- [Jekyll, a static site generator](http://klepas.org/jekyll-a-static-site-generator/) by 
Pascal Klein
- [Jekyll Blogs](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) by Jade Dominguez (this is based on Jekyll 
Bootstrap but it contains a lot of useful details for using Jekyll)


### Good to know

It's hard to give a list of all the things you'll need to get started with *jekyll*. It 
all depends on your experience building and developing weblogs, and how adventurous you 
feel to try new things. For those like me with a limited background here is my 
checklist of some concepts and tools to know about:

- [jekyll installation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
- installing [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
- installing [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/pages/download)
- working with [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) text formatting
- free hosting with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/)
