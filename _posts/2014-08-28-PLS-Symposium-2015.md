### Short Description

A couple of weeks ago I received an email from my colleague [Jose Luis Roldan](http://personal.us.es/jlroldan/Sitio_web/Index.html) letting me know that 
they have started to officially communicate the 
**2nd International Symposium on Partial Least Squares Path Modeling – The Conference for PLS Users** 

This second edition will take place next year (2015) between June 16-19 in beautiful Seville, Spain. 
You can check all the details in the symposium's website: [http://2015.pls-symposium.org./index.html](http://2015.pls-symposium.org./index.html)


This is a great opportunity for researchers in business and social sciences who 
apply PLS Path Modeling in different topics such as:

- Marketing
- International Business
- Strategic Management
- Information Systems
- Human Resource Management
- Organizational Behavior
- Service Management
- Operations Management
- Innovation Management
- Educational Research
- Psychology
- Environmental Research

Also it's good to know that there will be some great publishing opportunities. 
One of them will be a special issue of the **Journal of Business Research** 
titled *Prediction-oriented Modeling in Business Research by Means of Partial Least Squares Path Modeling.* 
Right now you have plenty of time to prepare something up since the papers 
submission deadline is 15 September 2015.

Here are the next two most immediate important dates:

- October 1, 2014 **Submission System Opens**
