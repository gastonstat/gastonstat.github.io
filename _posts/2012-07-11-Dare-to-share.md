Last night at the [Bay Area useR Group](http://www.meetup.com/R-Users/) July meeting, 
we had the opportunity to listening to [Norman Matloff](http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/matloff.html) 
and [Karthik Ram](http://nature.berkeley.edu/~kram/).

Norm started the session with a presentation on his ```"Rth"``` package. But the main 
dish was in charge of Karthik who spoke about R's role in facilitating 
[open science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science). You can check his slides 
about [R and Open Science](http://inundata.org/R_talks/BARUG/#intro).

From all the very interesting stuff mentioned by Karthik, the two main key ideas that 
resonated in my head after his talk were **sharing** and **collaboration**.

Basically, the main idea behind the open science movement can be put this way:

> Open the doors for the entire (scientific) community
> so everybody can see **how** you do your research.

Open science is much more than showing people what you do; open science is more about 
showing people not only what you did but more important HOW you did it. Writing a paper 
and making presentations help you show the things you do, but they don't actually show 
the details of how you do them. And you know: the devil is in the details.

Only when you dare to share is when you finally show the rest of the world how you do 
the things you do. The little problem, however, is that may of  us refuse to share our 
data, our code and our tools, mainly because we are afraid of the pirates and thieves 
that might steal all our precious work. It is true that this is a real threat but I 
think that the benefits outweigh the risks of adopting the open science philosophy.

Let me give you some of the benefits of sharing:

1. First, it is perfect for providing your work a longer lifetime! Just think about the 
tons of works that are now in oblivion inside some hard-drive of flash-drive without 
never watching the screenlight again. For instance, consider all those years of hard 
work that takes a grad student to get her PhD, with the corresponding data tables, 
code scripts, results, graphics, and so on. By sharing your work, you'll allow it to 
have a larger impact.

2. Second, by showing other people how you do your research, your colleagues can try 
to replicate your analysis, validate it, confirm your findings, and give you more 
recognition. It increases the chances of getting more citations, and also to become a 
reference for future applications.

3. Third, it can serve your future you. As Kharthik remarked it *"most science is not 
reproducible or repeatable, even within the same lab group over time*". This is a very 
strong reason to share your data and code, so you or anyone else in your lab, some time 
in the future, may reproduce/repeat the obtained results.

4. Fourth, it will force you to make sure that your data and code are as cleaner as 
possible. Of course, there will always be cases when some errors and bugs are still 
around, but here is where the external scrutiny comes handy because other users might 
detect something wrong that scaped your eyes.

5. Fifth, it will open new opportunities for collaboration. Since other researchers 
can actually see how you do what you are doing, they may be interesting in collaborating 
with you because they know how you work. An who knows, you might even get contacted by 
companies or recruiters interested in someone with your profile and skills.

So, next time you doubt about whether you should opening your science to the world, 
go for it and **dare to share**. If you want to know more about open science and R please

tools for facilitating Open Science.
