### Arc Diagrams Motivation

I don't know for sure when was the first time I saw the 
<a title="similar diversity" href="http://similardiversity.net/" target="_blank">Similar Diversity</a> 
arc diagram by Philipp Steinweber and Andreas Koller (it must have been somewhere at the 
end of 2009 or at the beginning of 2010).

<img class="centered" title="Similar Diversity" src="/images/blog/dataflow_page.jpg" />
</a> 

Anyway, the important thing is that I was immediately amazed by all the different 
features beautifully displayed in such a diagram. My obvious reaction was quite simple: 
*How the hell did they do it?*


### Star Wars Project

In the summer of last year (2012) I decided that it was time for me to try to do my own 
version of an arc diagram... in R. I had one single goal in mind: to get a visualization 
like <strong>Similar Diversity</strong>. Instead of using the holy books of the main 
religions in the world, I set a much more modest goal and try having fun with the 
**Star Wars movie scripts**. The main result of that project is this image:
