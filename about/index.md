## Summary

In the last 9+ years I've been spending my time working on a number of projects, 
most of them with the central theme of exploring, analyzing and visualizing data 
in a context of multiple variables and high dimensionality. 

This means that I've been revisiting the core concepts behind methods for 
association-relationship between multiple sets of variables (i.e. multiblock data) 
using different approaches from a broad range of disciplines (e.g. psychometrics, 
chemometrics, sensometrics, econometrics, ecology and biometrics).

In particular, I've done a lot of programming and development of software for statistical 
computations, graphics, and data analysis. Behind all the stuff that I’ve done there is a single idea and goal: 
**to build a succinct summary of the data I'm analyzing**.


## Overall Interests

There are 3 major topics that I'm hooked to:
 
- I really like [working](/work) with analytical tools 
and methods, especially those designed for very practical applications.
- I'm fascinated with the use of graphical displays to understand data with 
visualization.
- I'm a passionate R user as well as a 
[developer](/software) of statistical software in R.


## Blog

Occasionally, I like to talk about data analysis, visualization, statistics, R and 
related stuff in my blog [Data Analysis Visually EnfoRced](/blog).


## Trifecta

What I like about my "job" is that:

1. It can be applied to practically all sciences and disciplines;
2. Consequently, it has allowed me to open the doors of many different fields;
3. But most important, it has given me the fortune to work with very smart and talented 
people from all over the world (from whom I've learned so much).

# About this website

This website is my personal space where I try to declutter my ideas and put my 
projects in order. This is easier said than done.
  
- It only happens after many iterations and refinements
- During days and nights in front of a computer
- Fueled by dozens of cups of coffee and tea
- Sometimes listening to music, sometimes in silence
